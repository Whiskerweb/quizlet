-- Disable email confirmation in Supabase
-- This script should be run in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email
-- Or you can run this SQL to update the auth config

-- Note: The email confirmation setting is in the Supabase Dashboard UI, not in SQL
-- Go to: Authentication → Providers → Email → Toggle OFF "Confirm email"

-- However, we can also modify the trigger to not require email confirmation
-- The trigger will still work, but users won't need to confirm their email
